# Learning-Machine-Learning
Testing commonly used Machine Vision techniques on common datasets like IRIS and MNIST.

The two main projects are

- Learning Learning, From Scratch


The goal for this project is to show case commonly used Machine Learning methods on the IRIS
and MNIST dataset. This would include line fitting, Principal Component Analisis, k-means,
linear classification, logistic regression, kernel Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks.
It is created using python and without using any ML specific libraries.

- Learning with images


The goal for this project is to create autoencoders to generate im ages on the Celeb dataset.
This would include variational auto encoders and testing with different loss functions such as
VGG-Loss. It is created using python and without using any ML specific libraries
